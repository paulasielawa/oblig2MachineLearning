We picked regression for predicting stock prices, which is a good match for estimating continuous numbers like the closing price of Tesla (TSLA) stock. In our code, we used polynomial regression, a flexible approach that can handle the complex, non-linear patterns often seen in financial data. This choice helps in capturing the intricate dynamics of stock prices, which are not always straightforward. So, regression, especially with polynomial modeling, is a strong choice for our task.

We choose this task: Predict stock market price for TESLA.

Description of task: I want you to make a prediction algorithm which predicts the price of this stock on a specific date. Input will be date and output should be price of that stock (close value in the data file). You should also show the prediction percentage score.
